          <li class="terms_list_item">STANDARD COMMISSION STRUCTURES</li>
          <p class="terms_list_item_text">
            7.1. Your percentage depends on last month’s FTD: <br />FTD 0 = 25% from NGR <br />FTD
            1-5 = 30% from NGR <br />FTD 6-10 = 35% from NGR <br />FTD 11-20 = 40% from NGR
            <br />FTD 21-30 = 45% of NGR <br />FTD 31 and more = 50% of NGR <br />* FTD = First time
            deposit <br />* NGR = GGR x 80% – bonuses awarded – manual casino bonus – 5% x (deposits
            + withdrawals) <br />7.2. In case of Sub – Affiliate deals. Sub-Affiliate shall be
            entitled to receive 2 % from personal NGRc of all Affiliates of such Sub-Affiliate,
            which is calculated, according to the following formula:NGRc = NGR – (minus) payments
            which are made to the Partners and any related sum such as bank / payment comissions and
            taxes, if any. <br />7.3. A negative balance on one brand does not affect a positive
            balance on another brand. Payments are made for each brand separately and they are not
            bundled. FTD for the payment are summarized from all casinos you work with. <br />If the
            Affiliate’s account in the current accounting period has a negative balance up to 10.000
            Euros, it will not be carried over to the next accounting period. Negative balance more
            than 10.000 euros is carried over to the next accounting period deducting this 10.000
            euros. In other words, Ads Global Limited covers Affiliates’ financial risks up to
            10.000 euros. <br />If the Affiliate’s account in the current accounting period (from
            the first day of the month till the last day of the month) has a negative NGR under his
            own activity (Affiliate’s NGR), such as negative NGR would be carried over on the next
            month with the following rules (brackets used to denote negative sign): <br />0 >
            Affiliate’s NGR >= (10,000) EUR | Such as negative NGR would NOT be carried over for the
            next accounting period <br />(10,000) EUR > Affiliate’s NGR | Such as negative NGR would
            be carried over for the next accounting period plus (compensated by the Company) 10,000
            EUR <br />For example, Affiliate promotes 3 Brands and at the end of the accounting
            period has the following statistic: <br />Brand 1 | NGR (13,000) EURBrand 2 | NGR 4,000
            EURBrand 3 | NGR (3,000) EUR <br />Then at the beginning of the next accounting period
            Affiliate would have the following information about promoted brands: <br />Brand 1 |
            NGR (3,000) EUR, where 10,000 EUR were compensated and was not carried overBrand 2 | NGR
            0 EUR, as usual at the beginning of the accounting periodBrand 3 | NGR 0 EUR, where
            3,000 EUR were compensated and was not carried over <br />Moreover, as mentioned above,
            payouts for Brands do NOT sums. E.g. if Affiliate has a revenue share 50% terms, he
            would gain:0 EUR for Brand 1;2,000 EUR (4000 * 50% = 2000) for Brand 2;0 EUR for Brand
            3.
